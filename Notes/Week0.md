# Week 0 Summary
This week was all about getting comfortable with the basics of programming — like really basic. I learned how to define variables, write functions using def, and return values with return. We explored how data types like str, int, and float work.

We also touched on operators (+, -, %, etc.) and started understanding how to build logical steps using pseudocode. Python’s interactive mode made it easier to test things quickly, and writing clean code with proper comments was encouraged from the start.
