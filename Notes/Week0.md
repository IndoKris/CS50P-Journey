# Week 0 Summary
This week was all about getting comfortable with the basics of programming.
I explored how data types like str, int, and float work.
I learned how to define variables, write functions using def, and return values with return.

Also touched on operators (+, -, %, etc.) and started understanding how to build logical steps using pseudocode. Pythonâ€™s interactive mode made it easier to test things quickly, and writing clean code with proper comments was encouraged from the start.

Used string methods such as strip() and title() , Learned new way to write strings known as f-strings or formatted string.
```python
name = input("What's your name? ").strip().title()

# Print the output
print(f"hello, {name}")
```
Creating a user-defined function using "def" keyword !
```python
def main():

    # Output using our own function
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    hello(name)

    # Output without passing the expected arguments
    hello()


# Create our own function
def hello(to="world"):
    print("hello,", to)


main()
```
At last I got to learn more about the concept of "return"
```python def main():
    x = int(input("What's x? "))
    print("x squared is", square(x))


def square(n):
    return n * n


main()
```
