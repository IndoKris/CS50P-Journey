#  📚 CS50P Notes

Welcome to the **Notes** section of my CS50P (Harvard's Introduction to Programming with Python) journey! 

This folder contains **personal notes, code snippets, explanations**, and **takeaways** from each week of the course. It's a space for:

- Reinforcing key programming concepts  
- Keeping track of tricky ideas I struggled with and later understood  
- Sharing my learning in a way others can benefit from too  
- Writing things in my own words to internalize the material  
- Exploring some topics a little deeper with examples or questions

## 🗂️ Weekly Breakdown

### 📘 Week 0 – Introduction
- Variables, parameters, and arguments
- Using str, int, float, and operators
- def, return, and the basics of writing function
- Writing clean code with comments
- Bugs, debugging, and thinking like a programmer
- Practicing in Python interactive mode
- My thoughts on how logic applies before code

### 🧮 Week 1 – Functions, Conditionals
- Learned how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` for branching logic  
- Practiced combining conditions using `and`, `or`, and `not`  
- Explored Boolean values with `bool()` and True-False expressions  
- Used `match` statements and saw where it’s useful compared to if/elif  
- Tried `match case` with the `|` symbol to match multiple values in one line (e.g., `case "yes" | "y":`)  
- Discovered how the modulo operator `%` can be used to check for even/odd numbers or divisibility  
- Wrote compact expressions like `return True if (n % 2 == 0) else False`, and learned how this is called a conditional expression or one-liner return  
- Also realized this can often be simplified further to just `return n % 2 == 0` for better readability  
- Focused on writing *pythonic* code — simple, expressive, and elegant  
- Started building small interactive programs that behave differently based on user input   

### 🔁 Week 2 – Loops
- `while` and `for` loops
- `range()`, `break`, `continue`
- Nested loops
- Loops were tricky at first, but practice helped a lot
- I started using loops to automate repetitive tasks

### 📚 Week 3 – Exceptions
- `try`, `except`, `raise`
- Handling user input safely
- Finally understood the difference between errors and exceptions
- I experimented with crashing programs on purpose to learn better

### 📂 Week 4 – Libraries
- Importing standard and third-party libraries
- Using `random`, `statistics`, `sys`, `emoji`
- Learned how to read Python documentation (super useful!)
- Practiced by building mini programs using random numbers

### 📝 Week 5 – Unit Tests
- Testing with `pytest`
- Writing and structuring good test cases
- I started appreciating how helpful tests are when debugging
- Wrote some tests for my old code to see if it still worked

### 🔎 Week 6 – File I/O
- Reading/writing `.txt` and `.csv` files
- File handling best practices (`with` statement)
- Built a few basic file-based apps like a note saver and word counter
- It felt great to finally interact with real files

### 🧬 Week 7 – Regular Expressions
- Pattern matching with `re`
- Email validation, substitution, search
- Regex looked scary but became fun once I cracked the syntax
- Used regex to clean up text data from a file

### 🧱 Week 8 – Object-Oriented Programming
- `class`, `__init__`, `self`
- Creating custom objects and methods
- Started thinking in terms of data + behavior
- I created a few small class-based apps (like a Todo manager)

### 🧪 Week 9 – Final Project
- My own Python project combining all the above
- Planning, building, and documenting it
- I wanted to build something that solved a real problem for me
- Learned how to think through the structure before starting to code

## ✨ Tips for Review
- Notes are in `.md` and `.py` format.
- Most examples are followed by outputs or visual comments.
- These are my study notes — **may contain comments, trial snippets, or thoughts**.
- I added personal examples and even some fun bugs I encountered along the way
