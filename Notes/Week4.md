# Week 4 Summary

This week was where things really started to feel *powerful*. Instead of just writing code, I learned how to **extend** Python by importing **modules**, working with **APIs**, and using third-party tools like `cowsay` that somehow made everything unexpectedly entertaining.

This week was about **Python's modular magic**. I learned how to import standard modules like `random`, `statistics`, and `sys`, and how to use `from x import y` to grab only what I needed. Working with **command-line arguments** using `sys.argv` helped me build scripts that actually respond to inputâ€”kind of like making tiny command-line apps.
I hit a few bumps tooâ€”like when I learned the hard way what an `IndexError` isâ€”but handling those errors using `sys.exit()` and smart conditional checks made my programs more bulletproof.
And then came the real game changers: **packages, pip, and PyPI**. The idea that I could install Python packages made me feel like Iâ€™d unlocked the internet for my code.

# Working with APIs & JSON

I had so much fun learning how APIs work. Using the `requests` module, I could fetch real data from external services. Once I pulled the data, **parsing JSON** using Pythonâ€™s built-in `json` module was straightforward and deeply satisfying. It felt like I was finally speaking the language of the web.

Hereâ€™s a quick sample of how I handled an API response:

```python
import requests
import json

response = requests.get("https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json")
data = response.json()
print(f"ðŸª™ Bitcoin price in USD: ${data['bpi']['USD']['rate']}")
```
My Favourite part of this week was this....!!!
```python
import cowsay
import sys

if len(sys.argv) == 2:
    cowsay.cow(f"Hey there, {sys.argv[1]}! Keep coding!")
else:
    cowsay.trex("You're supposed to pass your name, hooman.")
```
Output of above program:
```

This is my favourite one !!
